# üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBoston Marathon Data Project

## Objective
In this project, I scrapped and analyzed data from the Boston marathon. The project steps include:

1. Scrapped data from the Boston Marathon Data website and loaded into a Dataframe for further processing.
2. Cleaned and transformed the data using Python on Jupyter Notebook.
3. Data analysis
4. Developed a dashboard on Tableau.

The sections below will explain additional details on the technologies and files utilized.

## Table of Contents

## Dataset Used

This project uses the 2024 Boston Marathon data which include fields capturing total time, age group, team, state, and time splits.

More info about dataset can be found in the following links:

* [Data Dictionary](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/results/search-results)
* [Raw Data (CSV)](https://github.com/JorlynLG/Boston-Marathon/blob/main/marthon_data.csv)

## Technologies
The following technologies are used to build this project:

* Language: Python
* Extraction and transformation: Jupyter Notebook
* Dashboard: Tableau

## Step 1: Data Scraping
In this step, I scraped all the race and personal attributes of each runner from the 2024 Boston marathon website.

I started by creating a list of the urls associated with each runnner.

I used the url list to extract personal and race result data on each runner. The list of variables includes: name, team, age group, state, finish time, and splits.

I separately extracted gender information because it was not provided on the individual urls.

## Step 2: Cleaning and Transformation
In this step, I loaded the dataframe created in Step #1 into Jupyter Notebook and carried out data cleaning and transformation activities required for futher analysis.

Data cleaning and transformation included:
* Drop duplicate entries
* Replacing all blank values
* Removing all entried where the runner did not complete the race or was disqualified
* Replacing all number values with integer type
* Replacing all time entries with a datetime
* Replacing all time splits with a deltatime

Refer to the following [script](https://github.com/JorlynLG/Boston-Marathon/blob/main/marathon_data_cleaning.ipynb 'Link to script') for more information. 

## Step 3: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Step 4: Dashboard
After completing the analysis, I created a separate dashboard to descibe the overall resulst of the race, which you can view [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jay.lee4373/viz/BostonMarathon_17170155415420/MarathonDashboard).
This dashboard focuses on the overall statistics of the race and not the analysis which was performed in the EDA stage.
