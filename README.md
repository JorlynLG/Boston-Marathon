# üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBoston Marathon Data Project

## Objective
In this project, I scrapped and analyzed data from the Boston marathon. The project steps include:

1. Scrapped data from the Boston Marathon Data website and loaded into a Dataframe for further processing.
2. Cleaned and transformed the data using Python on Jupyter Notebook.
3. Data analysis
4. Developed a dashboard on Tableau.

The sections below will explain additional details on the technologies and files utilized.

## Table of Contents

## Dataset Used

This project uses the 2024 Boston Marathon data which include fields capturing total time, age group, team, state, and time splits.

* [Raw Data (CSV)](https://github.com/JorlynLG/Boston-Marathon/blob/main/marthon_data.csv)

## Technologies
The following technologies are used to build this project:

* Language: Python
* Extraction and transformation: Jupyter Notebook
* Dashboard: Tableau

## Step 1: Data Scraping
In this step, I scraped all the race and personal attributes of each runner from the 2024 Boston marathon website.

I started by creating a list of the urls associated with each runnner.

I used the url list to extract personal and race result data on each runner. The list of variables includes: name, team, age group, state, finish time, and splits.

I separately extracted gender information because it was not provided on the individual urls.

## Step 2: Cleaning and Transformation
In this step, I loaded the CSV file into Jupyter Notebook and carried out data cleaning and transformation activities prior to organizing them into fact and dim tables.

## Step 3: Analysis

## Step 4: Dashboard
